/**
 * A simple helper struct that can be used at the beginning of each kernel to compute some usefull variables.
 * Don't worry about variables that you are not going going to use, because they are optimized away :).
 *
 * If you know the number of threads per block at compile time pass it as the first template argument.
 * LOCAL_WARP_SIZE can be used for example in partial warp reductions.
 * LOCAL_WARP_SIZE must be one of these values: 1,2,4,8,16,32
 *
 * Note: In some libraries you will find the __mul24 for these index computations, but from cuda 8 api:
 *  "_[u]mul24 are legacy intrinsic functions that have no longer any reason to be used"
 *
 * Note: It is important to use unsigend ints here, because then the compiler can replace expensive integer divisions
 * with fast bit shifts. The same counts when accessing these variables. Either use "auto" or "unsigend int".
