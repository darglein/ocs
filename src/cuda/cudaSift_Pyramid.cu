 Implementation of SIFT is based on the code from http://blogs.oregonstate.edu/hess/code/sift/

//    The following patent has been issued for methods embodied in this
//    software: "Method and apparatus for identifying scale invariant features
//    in an image and use of same for locating an object in an image," David
//    G. Lowe, US Patent 6,711,293 (March 23, 2004). Provisional application
//    filed March 8, 1999. Asignee: The University of British Columbia. For
//    further details, contact David Lowe (lowe@cs.ubc.ca) or the
//    University-Industry Liaison Office of the University of British
//    Columbia.

//    Note that restrictions imposed by this patent (and possibly others)
//    exist independently of and may be in conflict with the freedoms granted
//    in this license, which refers to copyright of the program, not patents
//    for any methods that it implements.  Both copyright and patent law must
//    be obeyed to legally use and redistribute this program and it is not the
//    purpose of this license to induce you to infringe any patents or other
//    property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims.  If you
//    redistribute or use the program, then this license merely protects you
//    from committing copyright infringement.  It does not protect you from
//    committing patent infringement.  So, before you do anything with this
//    program, make sure that you have permission to do so not merely in terms
//    of copyright, but also in terms of patent law.

//    Please note that this license is not to be understood as a guarantee
//    either.  If you use the program according to this license, but in
//    conflict with patent law, it does not mean that the licensor will refund
//    you for any losses that you incur if you are sued for your patent
//    infringement.
