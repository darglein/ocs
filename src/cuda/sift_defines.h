//    The following patent has been issued for methods embodied in this
//    software: "Method and apparatus for identifying scale invariant features
//    in an image and use of same for locating an object in an image," David
//    G. Lowe, US Patent 6,711,293 (March 23, 2004). Provisional application
//    filed March 8, 1999. Asignee: The University of British Columbia. For
//    further details, contact David Lowe (lowe@cs.ubc.ca) or the

//    Columbia.

//    Note that restrictions imposed by this patent (and possibly others)

//    of copyright, but also in terms of patent law.

//    Please note that this license is not to be understood as a guarantee
//    either.  If you use the program according to this license, but in
//    conflict with patent law, it does not mean that the licensor will refund
//    you for any losses that you incur if you are sued for your patent
